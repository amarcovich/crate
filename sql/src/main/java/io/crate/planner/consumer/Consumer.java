/**
 * <p>
 * A consumer is a component which can create a Plan for a relation.
 * A consumer plans only so far that the result is complete, but still distributed if possible.
 *
 * </p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     SELECT count(*), name from t group by 2
 *
 *                  |
 *
 *      NODE1      NODE2
 *       CP         CP
 *        |         |
 *        |         |
 *        |         |
 *       MP         MP      <--- Merge Phase / Reduce Phase
 *                               Result is "complete" here - so a consumer should stop planning here
 * </pre>
 *
 * Or:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     SELECT * from t        -- no limit
 *
 *     NODE1    NODE2
 *       CP       CP          <-- Result is complete
 *
 * BUT:
 *
 *     SELECT * from t limit 10
 *
 *     NODE1     NODE2
 *       CP        CP         <-- if CP includes limit 10 both nodes would result in 20 rows.
 *       |        /                 The result is incomplete
 *       |______/
 *       |
 *       MP (limit 10)        <-- Result is complete
 *                                (If it's on Node1 or Node2 doesn't matter)
 * </pre>
